## What is Tableau

[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/) is a data analysis and visualisation software. To get a sense of what  you can do with Tableau you can browse [this library](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/gallery/?tab=viz-of-the-day&type=viz-of-the-day).

Generally speaking, Tableau can be used to for these tasks:

* Read relatively large datasets of different formats;
* Clean (or prepare) your data;
* Explore your data;
* Connect your data (so this table with city *population* with that table with city *pollution*);
* Visualise your data through static or interactive (on a website) visualisation;
* Reporting and story telling with your data.
