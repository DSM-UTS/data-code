## The leading desktop software to visualize networks on Linux, Windows and Apple computers

-   more than 2 million downloads,

-   used by analysts, academics, journalists,

-   stable on Windows, Mac and Linux,

-   in continuous development

## open source & free (including for commercial purposes)

Gephi adopts a licencing model which makes it free to use, sell, or include the source code of Gephi in larger applications.

Developers who modify the Gephi code base are required to make these changes public, to benefit the community.

## \"Photoshop^TM^ for graphs\"

-   for networks of all types (social, semantic, biological, etc.)

-   attributes and properties of the network are made visible: not just the [topology](http://www.webopedia.com/quick_ref/topologies.asp) of the network.

-   Gephi provides functions to explore the network: pan, filter, zoom, colorize, label, etc.

-   measures and metrics can be computed, and then rendered visually.

## modular and extensible

-   Gephi is \"cut\" in a large number of modules, each providing a specific function. This makes it easier to maintain and evolve the software, by working on independent parts.

-   Since version 0.9 the [\"graph store\"](https://gephi.wordpress.com/2015/12/04/gephi-boosts-its-performance-with-new-graphstore-core/) of Gephi has become a completely independent module: it can be reused by another software.

-   Anybody can create new modules for Gephi! [They are called \"plugins\"](https://gephi.org/plugins/#/). They integrate with Gephi seamlessly.
