## Programming: principles and foundations

* [Programming Foundations](https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fprogramming-foundations-fundamentals-3%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url&account=2129308)

* [Computer Science Principles: Programming](https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fcomputer-science-principles-programming%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url&account=2129308)

* [Stanford's Programming Methodology](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL84A56BC7F4A1F852)

Programming Methodology (CS106A) is an introduction to the engineering of computer applications emphasizing modern software engineering principles: object-oriented design, decomposition, encapsulation, abstraction, and testing. Uses the Java programming language. Emphasis is on good programming style and the built-in facilities of the Java language.

## Python

* [Python Quick Start](https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fpython-quick-start%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url&account=2129308)

### Installing Python on your computer

Here a few links to video to help you install Python on your computer.

Whatever you do, make sure you install Python 3.`x` and not Python 2.`x` (`x` is for whatever number).

These videos will help you to install Python on your computer.

* [Installing Python on Windows](https://youtu.be/bnhQBUEpWlg)
* [Installing Python on Mac](https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Flearning-python-2%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url&account=2129308)

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) "is a free and open-source distribution of the Python". It doesn't only include Python but a number of other applications that you might find useful including:

* **JupyterLab**: "JupyterLab is the next-generation user interface for Project Jupyter. It offers all the familiar building blocks of the classic Jupyter Notebook (notebook, terminal, text editor, file browser, rich outputs, etc.) in a flexible and powerful user interface" 
* **Spyder**: "Spyder is an open source cross-platform integrated development environment (IDE) for scientific programming in the Python language".

### Graphical user interface apps with Python

Do you want to build an app with a Graphical user interface (GUI)? (Hey, what's a GUI?? [check out Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface)) There are a number of Python packages to help you with that. If you don't know which one to use we recommend you start with [TkInter](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter).
